* vector
* list
* deque
* arrays
* forward list

Container Adaptors: provide different interface for sequential containers.
* queue
* priority queue
* stack

Associative Containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched
O(logn) complexity.
* set
* multiset
* map
* multimap

Unordered Associative Containers: implement data structures that can be quickly searched
* unordered set
* unordered multiset
* unordered map
* unordered multimap
